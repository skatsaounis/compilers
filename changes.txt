-- Fixed T_num, T_char, T_string on lexer.l
-- Found out that p contains current function's symbol entry.
	Replaced the whole function's body lookup_in_curScope with one simple line.
	C Variables moved to top of file so as functions can access them.
-- atom ":=" expr call on equalType has been changed.
	Reason: a = b[c].  <- a.refT = int, b.refT = iarray(int)
	Before: equalType(lookup_type_in_arrays($1.refT), $3.refT)
	Now: equalType(lookup_type_in_arrays($1.refT), lookup_type_in_arrays($3.refT))
-- Change to Makefile. Header file dependencies were added
-- Change to Symbol.c Swich of function equalType wasn't complete. Filled empty case TYPE_IARRAY
-- Change to checkParams-- Now if !equal_types due to (int,I_ARRAY(int)) is passed. Before change error was printed on screen. (if condition inside outer else if)
-- Change to expr (<,>,<>,=,<=,>=). Combined with new equal_Types gives correct result. Before something like this (a[i] < b[j]) was considered as an error.
-- Change to a, b when checking parameters. Before something like this (quicksort(sort(a,b), quick(c,d), quicksort(e,f)) was considered having more or less arguements than expected. Guess why. :P From now on, when a call tag occurs, previous a is stored to a linked list.
